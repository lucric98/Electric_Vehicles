# Electric_Vehicles
Nonparametric Statistic project

PROJECT DESCRIPTION
Our project aims to study some characteristics of electric vehicles to assess the entire cost of an electric vehicle (knowing that by 2030 no fuel car will be allowed to circulate on the road). In this analysis we would like to compute the entire price of a car as the sum of:
 - price for purchasing the vehicle (we have it at our disposal)
 - price for running the car (cost of the fuel and life of the car)
